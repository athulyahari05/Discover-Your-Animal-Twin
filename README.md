### Project Description
Upload or snap a photo, and let our playful AI match you with your spirit animal. From majestic lions to sleepy alpacas, find your wild side with a hilarious caption that makes the resemblance unforgettable! 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are constantly wandering through life without knowing which animal they most resemble. This is clearly an urgent issue. Without this knowledge, how can one truly reach peak self-awareness?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôve harnessed the latest in photo recognition (and a healthy dose of absurdity) to finally answer life‚Äôs most pressing non-question: ‚ÄúWhat animal am I?‚Äù
Upload a photo (or take one live), and we‚Äôll pair you with your long-lost animal doppelg√§nger
